# Ford GoBike Data Exploration
## by Sarah Abdelkader


## Dataset

> The dataset that includes information is provided from "**Ford GoBike**" bike-sharing system that exists in the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data includes details about the daily bike trips performed durng the month of February 2019.


## Summary of Findings

> After performing several analysis processes, I can find that the relation between user age and duration of trips appears to be logical. 
> User with subscription use their bikes reguarly on weekdays whereas those who are not subscribed use the system less.
> Specific stations have the highest traffic. IT will be interesting to visualize those stations on a map and understand where they are located.
>Surprisingly, female users are more than male. However, that could happen because some user ignore inserting all details corectly, and that explains why we could have a large count of users with gender "other". 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Bike user segments ratio between subscriber and unsubscribed user.
> Relation between age, trip duration and count of trips done.
> Peak hours of activity along the day
>Use of bike to commute during working days
